# behavioral_structural_asymmetry
This repo includes Psychtoolbox, MATLAB, and Python scripts for running and analysing behavioral and structural data.

Scientific questions:
1) Is there individual behavioral biases toward one hemisphere?
2) Are behavioral asymmetries correlated with structural (subcortical structures) asymmetries?
